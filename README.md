# Breadth First Search (BFS) 

## GenerateMaze
This component generates a maze of specified dimensions.
To run the maze generator, execute the program with parameters indicating the dimensions of the maze and the output file. For example: java GenerateMaze 4 4 maze.dat 
This command generates a 4x4 maze and saves it to a file named maze.dat.

## MazeSolverBFS
Utilizes BFS algorithm to solve mazes generated by GenerateMaze.
To solve a maze, execute the MazeSolverBFS program. java MazeSolverBFS

The solver will navigate through the maze using BFS and provide the solution.
This project showcases the application of BFS in solving mazes generated by the provided dimensions. The GenerateMaze creates the maze file, and MazeSolverBFS uses BFS to find the solution within the generated maze.
